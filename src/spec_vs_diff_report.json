  "summary": "The diff implements multiple responsive-layout improvements (global overflow prevention, responsive Section gutters/padding, responsive Home/About/Contact/Offers/Menu layouts, responsive header/footer). However, the Menu Management page responsiveness requirements are not clearly evidenced in the provided MenuManagementPage.tsx diff snippet. The diff summary also indicates several unrequested feature additions/expansions (e.g., Gallery page/lightbox, SEO/meta updates, brand asset centralization, and large menu data refactor).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Make the Menu Management page responsive, including the tab list, forms, and action buttons, so it remains usable on mobile and tablet (no tabs or form inputs extending off-screen).",
      "reason": "The provided diff excerpt for MenuManagementPage.tsx shows logic and imports but does not show any responsive layout adjustments (e.g., TabsList wrapping/scrolling behavior, responsive form grid stacking, or responsive primary action button layout). Because the file content is truncated, there is insufficient evidence that the responsive UI changes required by REQ-4 were implemented.",
