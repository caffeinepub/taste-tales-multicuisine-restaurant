  "summary": "Core logo-path centralization and resilient logo rendering were implemented via a new BrandLogo component, updates to header/footer/home hero, updates to LogoMotif fallback handling, and corrected OG/Twitter + favicon references in frontend/index.html. However, the diff summary does not show the actual static image files being added/ensured under publicly served assets, and several unrequested broad styling/content changes appear to have been made.",
