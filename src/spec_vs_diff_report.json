  "summary": "Most core pages and routing are implemented (Home, About, Menu, Offers, Gallery, Contact) with a sticky responsive header, shared footer layout, and per-page SEO via a `Seo` component. However, the diff does not provide evidence of the static PDF asset required for menu download, and the Gallery implementation appears to omit the required “family seating” theme/images. There are also additional authentication/backend scaffolding pieces not requested in the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Provide a prominent “Download Menu (PDF)” button that downloads a static PDF file shipped with the frontend.",
      "reason": "The Menu page opens `/assets/menu.pdf`, but the diff summary does not show any added static PDF asset at that path (or similar), so the download target may not exist in the shipped frontend.",
