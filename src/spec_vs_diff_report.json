  "summary": "Diff updates `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts` with a large transcribed menu dataset, but the file is truncated in the summary, so exact compliance with the pasted menu text (including full section/item parity and special pricing rules) cannot be fully verified. No diff evidence shows updates or verification steps for global search content (`globalSearchContent.ts`) or `/search` behavior. Two non-requested metadata/docs-like files were also modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts` so categories/section headings and items (names, optional parenthetical descriptions, prices) exactly match the latest pasted menu text; remove anything not in the pasted text; headings match exactly; items with no price omit both `price` and `priceLabel`.",
      "reason": "Although `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts` was modified and appears to include many categories/items, the diff is truncated and does not provide enough evidence to confirm the dataset exactly matches the pasted menu text end-to-end, including removals/replacements, exact heading spelling/capitalization for all sections, and the rule for items that have no price (must omit both `price` and `priceLabel`).",

      "reason": "`MenuItem` includes a `priceLabel` field with a comment indicating its intent, but the truncated diff does not show any concrete items using `priceLabel` (or confirm that all multi-price items from the pasted text were encoded that way), nor does it show any UI/search formatting behavior changes.",

      "requirement": "Verify search consistency: `/menu` search finds updated items/categories; global search (`frontend/src/lib/globalSearchContent.ts` and `/search`) returns updated menu items with correct category names and correct price badges using `formatMenuPrice(item)` (including `priceLabel`).",
      "reason": "No changes are shown for `frontend/src/pages/MenuPage.tsx` (beyond being mentioned in a separate summary file) or for `frontend/src/lib/globalSearchContent.ts`. There is no diff evidence that global search results/badges were updated or verified against the updated menu data.",
