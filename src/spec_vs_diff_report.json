  "summary": "The diff does not provide direct evidence (within the truncated content) that the specific existing \"Mineral Water\" item in `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts` was updated to ₹20. The change set also appears to include broader, unrequested modifications such as expanding/rewriting the menu data structure and updating project tracking/summary files.",
  "missing_requirements": [

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update the existing menu item named \"Mineral Water\" in `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts` so its displayed price reflects an M.R.P. of ₹20 (price badge shows ₹20 in UI and global search results).",
      "reason": "In the provided (truncated) excerpt of `frontend/src/data/menuData.ts`, there is no visible entry for `name: \"Mineral Water\"`, nor any visible change showing its price set to 20. The `frontend-file-summaries.txt` mentions the change, but that is not the source-of-truth code and does not prove the implementation in the diff excerpt.",

    {
      "description": "Broader rewrite/expansion of menu data (multiple categories and many items) rather than only updating the single existing \"Mineral Water\" price.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows a large menu dataset and new/expanded structure being present in `menuData.ts`, which goes beyond the requested single-item price update and conflicts with the non-goal of no other menu item changes.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/data/menuData.ts (shows many categories/items and structural code beyond a one-line price change)"
      ]

      "description": "Added/introduced an optional `priceLabel` field for menu items.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest does not request updating documentation/summary files, and the file content references many unrelated routes/components (e.g., /search route, SEO helpers), which are out of scope for a Mineral Water price change.",
