- **Unknown changes**: Draft 19 changes were not documented in the current file summaries, so no specific exclusions were identified from this draft.

### Draft 23
- **Unknown changes**: Draft 23 changes were not documented in the current file summaries, so no specific exclusions were identified from this draft.

### Draft 25

## Notes

Since the file summaries did not contain specific information about what changed in Drafts 19, 23, and 25, this restoration focused on implementing the complete Draft 24 feature set as described in the implementation plan, which includes:

1. Full Gallery page implementation
2. Gallery navigation in header and footer
3. Robust image error handling
4. Responsive grid layout
5. Lightbox preview functionality
6. All routes properly wired

If there were specific UI changes, text changes, or feature modifications in Drafts 19, 23, or 25 that should be excluded, they would need to be identified through version control history or detailed change logs.
